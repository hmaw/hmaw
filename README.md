Hello, I'm a career re-starter, coming from Business Ops, Customer Success and Operations and returning into my first love of computers.  I wish to be that developer I dreamed of being in the past, like I wanted to do the first time but, but was drifed off course by real life. 

Went back to college, learned how to code and using all the skills that I had collected from using computers daily with it to become "Mostly Dangerous".
Started to find a that first job, but the world.exe had a virus, and it stopped my job search in it's tracks. 

Now, let's go and grab some more skills and level up so that I can get an amazing job as mid-level developer when things calm back down.   

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... Modern Javascript in depth with CssGrid and VueJs.  
- ðŸ”­ In the future, I'd love to explore more in ML, AR/VR, and virtural world ethics. 
I enjoy talking about tiki culture, watercolors, and gaming.

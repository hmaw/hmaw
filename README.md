Hello, I'm a career re-starter, coming from Business Ops, Customer Success and Operations and returning into my first love of computers.

I wish to be that developer I dreamed of being in the past, like I wanted to do the first time but, but was drifed off course by real life. 

Went back to college, learned how to code and using all the skills that I had collected from using computers daily with it to become "good".

Started to find a job, but the world.exe had a virus, and it stopped my job search in it's tracks. 

Now, let's go and grab some more skills and level up so that I can get a job as mid level developer!  

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... Modern Javascript in depth with CssGrid and VueJs.

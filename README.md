Hello, I'm a career re-starter, enjoying my first love of computers.  I wish to be that developer I dreamed of being as a teen, but was drifed off course by real life and quesstionable advice.  Back on track again and having the time of my life.

Started to find that first job, but the world.exe had a virus, and it stopped my job search in it's tracks. Took a consulting job and learned HEAPS of everything.   I am forgeing on and learn as much as I can while the world recovers and enjoying the joy of taking a break due to layoffs.

Now, let's go and grab some more skills and level up so that I can get an amazing job as Senior developer when things calm back down.   

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... Modern Javascript & Typescript in depth with CssGrid and VueJs with AWS certs, after using Agile and Salesforce.
- ðŸ”­ In the future, I'd love to explore more in AI, ML, AR/VR, and virtural world ethics. I want to see how the front end world can be joined with XR responsbily.
I enjoy talking about automating sprout growing/hydroponics, tiki culture, watercolors, anime, and gaming.

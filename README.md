Hello, I'm a full stack devloper, career re-starter, coming from Business Ops, Customer Success and Operations and returning into my first love of computers.  I wish to be that developer I dreamed of being, but was drifed off course by real life and bad advice. 

Went back to college, learned how to code and using all the skills that I had collected from using computers daily with it to overcome from being "Mostly Dangerous" to competent.
Started to find that first job, but the world.exe had a virus called Corona, and it stopped my job search in it's tracks, leaving me ghosted. 

Now, let's go and grab some more skills and level up so that I can get an amazing job as mid-level developer when things calm back down.   

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... Modern Javascript in depth with CssGrid and VueJs.  
- ðŸ”­ In the future, I'd love to explore more in ML, AR/VR, and virtural world ethics. I want to see how the front end world can be joined with XR.
I enjoy talking about tiki culture, watercolors, anime, and gaming.

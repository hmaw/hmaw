Hello, I'm a full stack devloper, career re-starter, coming from Business Ops, Customer Success and Operations and returning into my first love of computers.  I wish to be that developer I dreamed of being, but was drifed off course by real life and bad advice. 

Went back to college, learned how to code and using all the skills that I had collected from using computers daily with it to overcome from being "Mostly Dangerous" to mostly competent.  Am now working on the next bit, "Amazing in Cloud".
Started to find that first job, but the world.exe had a virus, and it stopped my job search in it's tracks.  I am forgeing on and learn as much as I can while the world recovers.

Now, let's go and grab some more skills and level up so that I can get an amazing job as Senior developer when things calm back down.   

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... Modern Javascript in depth with CssGrid and VueJs with AWS certs.  In work hours, its everything Salesforce.
- ðŸ”­ In the future, I'd love to explore more in ML, AR/VR, and virtural world ethics. I want to see how the front end world can be joined with XR.
I enjoy talking about automating sprout growing, tiki culture, watercolors, anime, and gaming as well.

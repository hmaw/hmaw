Hello, I'm a career re-starter, returning into my first love of computers.  I wish to be that developer I dreamed of being, but was drifed off course by real life and quesstionable advice.  

Started to find that first job, but the world.exe had a virus, and it stopped my job search in it's tracks.  I am forgeing on and learn as much as I can while the world recovers.

Now, let's go and grab some more skills and level up so that I can get an amazing job as Senior developer when things calm back down.   

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... Modern Javascript in depth with CssGrid and VueJs with AWS certs, after using Agile and Salesforce.
- ðŸ”­ In the future, I'd love to explore more in ML, AR/VR, and virtural world ethics. I want to see how the front end world can be joined with XR responsbily.
I enjoy talking about automating sprout growing/hydroponics, tiki culture, watercolors, anime, and gaming.
